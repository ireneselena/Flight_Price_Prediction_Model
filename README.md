# Flight Price Prediction

## Overview

The **Flight Price Prediction** project is designed to accurately predict flight ticket prices using advanced machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various factors such as flight duration, departure time, days left until departure, and airline, this project aims to provide travelers with insights into flight price trends and help them make informed booking decisions.

## Analysis

### Feature Engineering
We carefully selected and engineered features such as departure time, arrival time, days left until departure, and airline to capture the key factors influencing flight prices. These features are critical in predicting price fluctuations and understanding market dynamics.

### Predictive Modeling
Our machine learning model leverages regression techniques to predict flight prices with high accuracy. This model allows travelers to anticipate price changes and optimize their booking strategies, potentially saving them money.

### Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to ensure its reliability and effectiveness. A cost-benefit analysis was also performed to quantify the potential savings for travelers.

## Objectives

- **Predict Flight Prices**: Provide travelers with accurate flight price predictions to help them make better booking decisions.
- **Understand Price Drivers**: Analyze and interpret the factors that most significantly influence flight prices.
- **Improve Travel Planning**: Enable travelers to plan their trips more effectively by anticipating price changes.

## Implementation

1. **Data Collection**: We gathered and preprocessed flight data, including variables such as airline, departure time, and days left until departure.
2. **Model Development**: Regression models were developed and fine-tuned using Python, optimizing for metrics like MAE and MAPE.
3. **Prediction on Unseen Data**: The model was applied to unseen data to test its accuracy in real-world scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model implementation.
